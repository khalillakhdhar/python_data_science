# LucidProgramming MailList

- If you would enjoy getting an email from me periodically about how to best make use of the content
on my channel and how to improve your own coding skills, consider joining this mailing list:

. . . 

- Purpose: To enhance the content on my channel and to provide extra goodies that I'm not able to
provide via YouTube.

. . .

- To stay up-to-date on what I have planned and to provide direct input and feedback on what I
will be covering. I read all of the emails I receive and do my best to respond to each one.

. . .

- To use as another tool in your toolbelt to improve your programming skills.
 
. . .

- To establish a more intimate connection with the viewers of my channel and with the servies
I attempt to provide. To figure out how to serve the dedicated viewers in more optimized ways.

# Viewers like You

will directly guide my content creation to serve the most amount of people to the utmost of my ability.

. . .

in class, want to see a good use of a Python module or technique, etc. Let me know in the comments.
